  "additional_four_1":"     An earthquake is caused by the complex motion of the Earth and the various processes that constantly occur within it. The Earth is in constant motion from West to East at 463 meters per second around its axis. And it itself is one of the planets of the solar system, and the other revolves around the Sun \n♦     It moves at a speed of 29 kilometers. And the solar system is constantly moving around the Galaxy at a speed of about 200 kilometers per second. In addition, the Earth's crust is in constant motion under the influence of the interaction of large plates in it and the complex mechanical, chemical and other complex processes in its deep layers. \n♦     In seismogenic zones where earthquakes occur, the elastic force and the accumulated force are gradually accumulated under the influence of external and internal forces\n♦     in the furnace of the earthquake, when the hardness point of the mountains passes through the boundary of the plates of different sizes on the ground move one side against the other. As a result, the elastic energy stored in the seismic furnace turns into mechanical energy and comes to motion in the form of seismic waves. The more energy stored in the seismic furnace, the stronger the earthquake. \n♦     Earthquakes occur mainly in the three seismic belts of the Earth's sphere. Approximately 84-85 percent of them occur in the Pacific seismic belt, 10-15 percent occur in the Mediterranean-Asian seismic belt, 1-3 percent occur in submarine rock formations located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and 1-2 percent occur in other various areas of the Earth's sphere. The countries of Central Asia, including Uzbekistan, are located in the Mediterranean-Asian seismic belt.\n♦     According to modern mobilistic theory, the Indian plate is in constant motion from south to north, it collides with the Eurasian plate and causes earthquakes that occur in Central Asia. Of course, this is the simplest concept. In fact, this collision is incredibly complex. Because the plates are not at one point colliding a few hundred kilometers away. Most of the impact force affects the formation of mountains, as well as layers as deep as 200-300 kilometers. During the geological period of the present, the process of mountain climbing in Central Asia continues. The rate of ascent varies from area to area and is about a year in mountain climates. \n♦     If 1 centimeter rises, in the lower planes the rate of ascent is much lower, which is a few millimeters. As a result, various surges, glitches, and other complex movements occur in the more mountainous areas. Of course, high pressure, temperature, and other complex processes in the Earth's deepest layers will not affect the flow itself. Thus, earthquakes are natural phenomena that are caused by their extremely complex internal and external forces slowly accumulating \n♦     in the Earth's crust.",

  "intro" : "    Strong earthquakes – are the most terrible among natural phenomena, it has the power to cause serious damage to buildings and structures and is observed with shaking greater than 5 points. This natural phenomenon is noted in the seismically active regions of the Republic of Uzbekistan.. Imagine, you are sitting at home, suddenly an earthquake has begun, the lights in the house, the vibration of the mirror cabinets make you panic with further fear, and when the screams on the street begin,  a person must perform the right action without losing himself.  The fear and panic that occurs in people when an earthquake occurs can lead to actions that are dangerous for his life. Citizens who live permanently in seismically active areas or who are temporarily staying there with services or proceedings should be aware of simple precautions and safety regulations in advance in order to be able to use them in practice when an earthquake occurs.

In such conditions, before the arrival of rescuers or medical workers, others will have to provide assistance to the victims, take measures to improve their condition. These measures are called first aid.\n♦    First aid is a set of simple measures provided at the scene of an emergency or an unfortunate event, aimed at saving the life of the victim and preventing deterioration of the condition.\n♦    First aid is provided by non-medics, regardless of education and age. Most often, during strong earthquakes, there may be situations where, as far as possible, it is necessary to provide assistance to the victims as soon as possible (within a few minutes).\n♦    Such situations include respiratory arrest and palpitations, heavy bleeding, loss of consciousness, severe injuries, etc.\n♦    The release of victims from the rubble is carried out with the use of precautionary measures.\n♦    When providing first aid, it is necessary to conduct an initial examination of the victim\n♦    At the same time, first of all, attention is paid to the presence of consciousness, breathing, heartbeat.\n♦    When determining the presence of breathing, it is necessary to free the upper part of the chest and neck from clothes, scarves, scarves, ties.\n♦    At the same time, the presence of a heartbeat is determined. To do this, on the outer surface of the larynx, applying the fingers, we determine the pulse - the beat of the arterial vessel.",

When breathing is restored, they are left in this position .\n♦    If breathing is not restored, the victim is laid on his back, his head is bent as far back as possible. And if at the same time breathing is not restored, then artificial respiration begins immediately.\n♦    Artificial respiration is carried out mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-nose and mixed (in young children) .\n♦    Procedure for performing artificial respiration.\n♦    With one palm we apply to the forehead of the victim, with the thumb and forefinger we pinch the wings of the nose, with the other hand we apply a clean cloth (gauze, bandage, handkerchief) to the mouth, protruding the lower jaw forward, inhale air into the lungs. Let's look at the chest. When properly inflated, the chest rises. The frequency of inhalations should be at least 15 - 17 times per minute. From time to time we check the presence of a pulse.\n♦    Artificial respiration is carried out until breathing is restored or until the arrival of rescuers or medical workers.\n♦    In the absence of a heartbeat (no pulse), it is necessary, without wasting time, to proceed with artificial respiration and closed heart massage. In this case, two breaths and 30 chest compressions are performed.\n♦    The victim must be laid on a hard and even surface, the legs are in an elevated position. We put the hands on the sternum and carry out 30 pressures by 4-5 cm, depending on the physique of the victim. After that, we determine the presence of a pulse. In the absence of a pulse (heartbeat), we continue the closed heart massage. If the pulse appeared, we carry out only artificial respiration.\n♦    Carrying out artificial respiration and closed heart massage to the victim is called cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n♦    LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (SYNCOPAL CONDITION). A condition in which blood circulation and oxygen supply to the brain are interrupted for a short time. The causes of this condition are physical and mental stress, stress, strong excitement, exacerbation of a chronic disease.\n♦    Main signs.

This leads to a violation of blood circulation in the place of compression, and thus, over time, various toxins accumulate in this part of the body. If in such cases the squeezing factor is eliminated, then the accumulated toxins enter the circulatory system and thereby cause poisoning of the whole organism. The kidneys are not able to remove these toxins from the body in a short time and acute renal failure occurs. This condition in victims after being removed from the rubble is called prolonged compression syndrome or \n♦    CRASH syndrome .\n♦    Signs of the syndrome: Swelling of the place of compression, pallor of the skin, lowering of local temperature, weakness or absence of a pulse below the place of compression.",

Therefore, regardless of the nationality of the citizens living in the seismically active areas of our country, it is desirable to study the correct actions to be taken before an earthquake, during an earthquake, and after an earthquake has occurred.\n♦     At the same time, in accordance with the long-term seismic forecast, taking into account the possible risk of strong earthquakes, the prevention of emergency situations and actions in such situations should be carried out by ministries and departments that are part of the state system (hereinafter - SSChS), as well as in facilities located under their jurisdiction for a long time (1-10 years), medium (1-12 months) and short-term (1-30 days) in accordance with earthquake forecasts, preventive measures must be taken to ensure seismic safety, as well as the structure, strength and means that should be in readiness at the junction of regions when forecast data are received, and also be able to quickly enter the territory of an emergency.\n♦     It is known that, in accordance with the current legislation, the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic of Uzbekistan performs the function of managing the activities of the State Emergency Service and exercising state control.\n♦     When the Ministry of Emergency Situations receives forecasts of strong earthquakes in the country (long-term, medium-term and short-term) from the Academy of Sciences, all segments of the population are informed about the danger of emergencies associated with strong earthquakes, including the functional services of the State Emergency Service.\n♦     Strong earthquakes themselves are recorded as emergencies, which may also result in other types of natural, man-made and environmental emergencies. In particular, residential houses of the population, social facilities and buildings run by organizations, and secondary emergencies associated with the collapse of buildings and structures due to a strong earthquake, as well as accidents, fires and explosions at economically important and categorized objects, are under threat. energy and utility systems.\n♦     The best foreign experience in dealing with the consequences of major emergencies shows that the adoption and implementation of measures to prevent them are more economical and effective than the elimination of consequences when they occur.\n♦     Therefore, in order to ensure the seismic safety of the population and territories in the Republic, an algorithm of actions carried out by all segments of the population before an earthquake, including citizens before an earthquake, during an earthquake and after an earthquake, as well as by the relevant functional services of the State Emergency Service in accordance with long-term forecasts of strong earthquakes, is being studied.",
